# This is a traditional face recognition algorithm, Eigenface, in CAS-PEAL dataset. # 
- I use Training Set to calculate eigenvector matrix and eigenvalues which has 300 people and 4 different state everyone.
- I use Gallery to sign in 1200 people who will multiply eigenvector to a low dimensional space!
- I use Probe Set to evaluate this algorithm performance in different state (e.g. Pose, Expression, Accessories, and Lighting)

But I think will have something wrong and sincerely hope you can tell me this wrong codes!
